## Overview
In this project, we combine geospatial data, earthquake records, and venue preferences to provide a multi-dimensional view of Moroccan cities. The goal is to understand the characteristics of cities in terms of earthquakes and social venues. The insights from this study can support investors, city managers, planners, and researchers in their decisions and analyses.

## Datasets
1. Earthquake data for Moroccan cities.
2. Venue data from the Foursquare API.
3. Geospatial data indicating geological features.

## Key Findings
- Relationship between earthquake magnitudes and proximity to geological features.
- Patterns in venue popularity in earthquake-prone regions.
- Regional variations in earthquake occurrences and magnitudes.
- Insights into preparedness measures for cities with significant seismic activity.


## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Geopandas
- Matplotlib
- Foursquare API
